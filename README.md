This project is an accessible joystick-controlled keyboard and mouse combo, which allows for improved accessibility for individuals who may need additional accomodations to confortably use a computer.

Key files: 
- Joystick Visualizer: uses pyGame to visualize the location of the joyscick at any given time
- Combined Mouse & Keyboard - the main python file to control the output, also includes the visualizer
- Mouse_Keyboard - the code running on the arduino for joystick functionality
